Even though we have taken help from the following students and LLMs in terms of discussing ideas and coding practices, all our code is written by us.
We have discussed with following LLMs and students:
* LLMs:  ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity.ai
Students: 
* Sidhharth Tamak (2025AIB2670)
* Jayesh Choudhari(2025AIB3002)

In our code we have initialised our state with a greedy approach and after this initialization we do local beam search. We do this for a fixed depth or until we get stuck in a local minima, in both these cases we generate random state again and do local beam search from that state if it is better than the current best.
